Navigation
---
All pages with *title* in frontmatter go to menu. They are sorted by *nav-weight* from frontmatter (small values go first).

Helpers
---
*_config.dev.yml* is extremely useful during development. It can alter some variables. Start Jekyll with
```
jekyll build --config "_config.yml,_config.dev.yml" --watch
```
